/*
    What are decorators?
    Decorators are special functions that can be attached to classes,
    methods, properties, or parameters to modify behavior or add metadata. 
    They are mostly used for:

    Logging
    Validation
    Access control
    Dependency injection

    Enable decorators in TypeScript
    In your tsconfig.json:

    {
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
    }

    if you dont have one just add it in compiler options in tsconfig.json
